BrowseraConnector
=================
BrowseraConnector is a small C# library to access the API of [Browsera](http://www.browsera.com). 

**Warning the library is currently in the alpha state and every part of the API is subject to change!**

## Features
- Low level wrapper to directly access the API
- Wrapper to start a test run or create new sites
- Poller that allows starting of a run and polling the results (images, etc...) into an output directory. This can be used to integrate Browsera more easily into a build pipeline. It is available through C# or as a console program.


## Todo
- Proper exceptions
- Wrap into MSBuild task
